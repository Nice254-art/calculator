# Math Operations Calculator 🧮✨

A simple Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-provided numbers.

## Features 🌟
- Takes two numbers as input (supports decimals)
- Performs four fundamental mathematical operations:
  - Addition ➕
  - Subtraction ➖
  - Multiplication ✖️
  - Division ➗
- Displays all results in a clean, formatted output

## How to Use 🚀
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system
2. Run the script in your terminal/command prompt:
   ```
   python math_operations.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to enter your two numbers
4. See the results of all four operations displayed!

## Example Usage 💡
```
Enter the first number: 12.5
Enter the second number: 4

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 16.5
Difference: 8.5
Product: 50.0
Quotient: 3.125
```

## Notes ⚠️
- The script doesn't currently handle division by zero errors - be careful not to enter 0 as the second number!
- All inputs are converted to floats to support decimal numbers

## Future Improvements 🔮
- Add error handling for division by zero
- Include more operations (exponents, modulus, etc.)
- Add input validation
- Create a GUI version

Created with Python and math magic! ✨🔢
